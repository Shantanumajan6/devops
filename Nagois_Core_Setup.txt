Perform these steps to install the pre-requisite packages.

yum install -y gcc glibc glibc-common wget unzip httpd php gd gd-devel

Downloading the Source
cd /tmp
wget -O nagioscore.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/archive/nagios-4.3.4.tar.gz
tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz

Compile
cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.3.4/
./configure
make all

Create User And Group
useradd nagios
usermod -a -G nagios apache

Install Binaries
This step installs the binary files, CGIs, and HTML files.

make install

Install Service / Daemon
This installs the service or daemon files and also configures them to start on boot. The Apache httpd service is also configured at this point.

===== CentOS 5.x / 6.x | RHEL 5.x / 6.x | Oracle Linux 5.x / 6.x =====

make install-init
chkconfig --add nagios
chkconfig --level 2345 httpd on

Install Command Mode
This installs and configures the external command file.

make install-commandmode


Install Configuration Files
This installs the *SAMPLE* configuration files. These are required as Nagios needs some configuration files to allow it to start.

make install-config

Install Apache Config Files 
This installs the Apache web server configuration files. Also configure Apache settings if required.

make install-webconf
You need to allow port 80 inbound traffic on the local firewall so you can reach the Nagios Core web interface.

===== CentOS 5.x / 6.x | RHEL 5.x / 6.x | Oracle Linux 5.x / 6.x =====

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
service iptables save
ip6tables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
service ip6tables save


Create nagiosadmin User Account 

You'll need to create an Apache user account to be able to log into Nagios.

The following command will create a user account called nagiosadmin and you will be prompted to provide a password for the account.

htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin

Installing Nagios Core From Source

This document describes how to install Nagios Core from source.

This guide is broken up into several sections and covers different operating system (OS) distributions. If your OS Distribution is not included in this guide then please contact us to see if we can get it added. Some distributions may be missing as we don't have access to a test environment that allows us to develop the documentation.

Nagios Core 4.3.4 and Nagios Plugins 2.2.1 is what this guide instructs you to install, however future versions should also work fine with these steps.

This documentation is broken up into two distinct sections:

Install Nagios Core

Install Nagios Plugins

This separation is to make a clear distinction as to what prerequisite packages are required by the OS it is being installed on. For example the SNMP packages are installed as part of the Nagios Plugins section, as SNMP is not required by Nagios Core.

 

Please select your OS:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

CentOS

Oracle Linux

Ubuntu

SUSE SLES | openSUSE Leap

Debian

Raspbian

Fedora

Arch Linux

Gentoo

FreeBSD

Solaris

Apple OS X

 

 

 

CentOS | RHEL | Oracle Linux
Security-Enhanced Linux

This guide is based on SELinux being disabled or in permissive mode. Steps to do this are as follows.

sed -i 's/SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/selinux/config
setenforce 0
 

Prerequisites

Perform these steps to install the pre-requisite packages.

yum install -y gcc glibc glibc-common wget unzip httpd php gd gd-devel
 

Downloading the Source

cd /tmp
wget -O nagioscore.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/archive/nagios-4.3.4.tar.gz
tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz
 

Compile

cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.3.4/
./configure
make all
 

Create User And Group

This creates the nagios user and group. The apache user is also added to the nagios group.

useradd nagios
usermod -a -G nagios apache
 

Install Binaries

This step installs the binary files, CGIs, and HTML files.

make install
 

Install Service / Daemon

This installs the service or daemon files and also configures them to start on boot. The Apache httpd service is also configured at this point.

===== CentOS 5.x / 6.x | RHEL 5.x / 6.x | Oracle Linux 5.x / 6.x =====

make install-init
chkconfig --add nagios
chkconfig --level 2345 httpd on
 

===== CentOS 7.x | RHEL 7.x | Oracle Linux 7.x =====

make install-init
systemctl enable nagios.service
systemctl enable httpd.service
 

Information on starting and stopping services will be explained further on.

 

Install Command Mode

This installs and configures the external command file.

make install-commandmode
 

Install Configuration Files

This installs the *SAMPLE* configuration files. These are required as Nagios needs some configuration files to allow it to start.

make install-config
 

Install Apache Config Files 

This installs the Apache web server configuration files. Also configure Apache settings if required.

make install-webconf
 

Configure Firewall

You need to allow port 80 inbound traffic on the local firewall so you can reach the Nagios Core web interface.

===== CentOS 5.x / 6.x | RHEL 5.x / 6.x | Oracle Linux 5.x / 6.x =====

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
service iptables save
ip6tables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
service ip6tables save
 

===== CentOS 7.x | RHEL 7.x | Oracle Linux 7.x =====

firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
 

Create nagiosadmin User Account 

You'll need to create an Apache user account to be able to log into Nagios.

The following command will create a user account called nagiosadmin and you will be prompted to provide a password for the account.

htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
 

When adding additional users in the future, you need to remove -c from the above command otherwise it will replace the existing nagiosadmin user (and any other users you may have added).

 

Start Apache Web Server

===== CentOS 5.x / 6.x | RHEL 5.x / 6.x | Oracle Linux 5.x / 6.x =====

service httpd start

Start Service / Daemon

This command starts Nagios Core.

service nagios start


Test the Nagois core.

http://ip/nagois -- promts username and password, so need to provide the same which we created a while back.
